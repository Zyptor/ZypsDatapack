# Short info!
I'm creating my own datapack for the Origins Mod for Fabric. It replaces Origins layer with it's own but it supports close to all other Origins Addons out there. I've     done it like this 'cause the main point of my datapack (except implimenting my own Origins) is putting out reworks of excisting Origins. Right now I have reworked Avian and working on a rework for Blazeborn and Monke.

If you wanna try out my full datapack replacing the normal origins with my reworks plus adding my own origins go ahead and download the ZypsDatapack.zip. More info in the wiki.

If you only wanna play with my own origins or my own reworks go ahead and download ZypsOrigins.zip and/or ZypsReworks respectivly. I think their names says it all but for extra clarification, ZypsOrigins adds my own origins too all the others and ZypsReworks adds my reworks to all the other origins.

Currently playable but not finnished, will be soon in a future version!
